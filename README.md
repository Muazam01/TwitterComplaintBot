# TwitterComplaintBot
This is an automated software that will send a tweet to the Internet service provider if the speed is lower than promised
For this project to work you have to follow these steps:
- You have to add yor download and upload speed for the constant ISP_DOWNLOAD_SPEED and ISP_UPLOAD_SPEED
- This is the software I made for my internet service provider(AIRTEL) if you have to change to your ISP you have to add your ISP provider their twitter account link
- If this program doesn't work the reason may be because you have not provided the correct url for the ISP provider
